## What happened to the Google Drive feature?  
## What happened to the Activity Recognition feature?  

The app has been [removed from Google Play](https://github.com/mendhak/gpslogger/issues/849) and has [moved to F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.mendhak.gpslogger/).  As part of [F-Droid's Inclusion Policy](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Inclusion_Policy/), proprietary libraries are not allowed, only open source libraries are allowed.  This meant that the Activity Recognition feature and the Google Drive feature had to be removed from the app.    

While it may be possible to reimplement a Google Drive upload in the future, the Activity Recognition is unlikely to ever happen, unless an open source library for it gets created.  

There may still be references to these features in screenshots, FAQ and dialogs.  Please ignore those for now.
